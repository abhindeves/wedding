## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft gold (#D4AF37) to evoke elegance and celebration. Chosen to avoid literal cliche of white in weddings, and to work well in a dark scheme.
- Background color: Light cream (#F5F5DC), a very desaturated yellow, for a warm, inviting feel in a light scheme.
- Accent color: Dusty rose (#BC8F8F) for highlighting key actions, chosen as an analogous color that's distinct from the primary.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern sans-serif with an elegant, fashionable, high-end feel; body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif suitable for body text
- Masonry-style responsive grid for photo gallery.
- Elegant, minimalist icons for likes, downloads, and sharing.
- Subtle fade-in animations when loading new photos or sections.
